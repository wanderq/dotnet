The dotnet repository is the starting point to engage in and learn about .NET
open source projects from [Microsoft](http://microsoft.github.io) and the
[.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/). You can read the more detailed post
[.NET Core is Open Source](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source.aspx)
on the .NET blog.

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

.NET open source projects from Microsoft (gladly) accept PRs and other
contributions. To contribute to ASP.NET 5 or EntityFramework, see
[the ASP.NET Contributing Guide](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
To contribute to .NET Core, see the
[.NET Core Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Contributing).

You are also encouraged to start a discussion by posting on the
[.NET Foundation Forums](http://forums.dotnetfoundation.org/) or filing an issue
in the corresponding GitHub project. See the contributing guides for more
details.

## .NET Foundation

Most .NET open source projects at Microsoft have been contributed to the
[.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects). There are two main
.NET Foundation projects for Microsoft open source projects:
[ASP.NET Core 5 project](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/aspnet-5)
and the [.NET Core project](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/netcore).
